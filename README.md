## Preparation

The project needs midi files to work on. One of the small datasets for midi files is [js-fakes](https://github.com/omarperacha/js-fakes). 
Clone the repo and get midi files from `midi` folder somewhere easy accessible.

Also run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The above command should install all required packages into your environment.

## Repository Structure

Repository is structured from `experiments` folder and, in the future, folders will be added to contain source files. Unless the codes are part of the final pipeline, they should be put in `experiments` folder.
